        <p><i>“In a forest, you can see one third of it, which is the trees. But two-thirds are underground. It&apos;s like the roots that go down. And the way trees communicate with each other is through mycelium. And mycelium is a mushroom. It&apos;s a fungus. The whole of the forest communicates through this layer of mushrooms. Mushrooms are a great connector and you can think about that analogy… imagine yourself as a tree. And you&apos;ve got your trunk, which is your connection to yourself. And you&apos;ve got your branches which are your ideas going out. And then you&apos;ve got your roots and you&apos;ve got this layer of mycelium and you&apos;re connected to all these other people. And so to make your tree grow really strong, it&apos;s about your place in the forest. You&apos;re not standing alone.”</i></p>
